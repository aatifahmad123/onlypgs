Pricing Rule (Important – Locked)

❗ Prices are NOT stored generically at PG level.
❗ Every price is tied strictly to a room type for a specific PG.


This ensures: - No misleading price ranges - Clear comparison across PGs - Accurate filtering by room type


All pricing lives only in the rooms collection.
